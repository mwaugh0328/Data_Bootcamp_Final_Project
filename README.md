# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project

This project was completed by Michael Waugh in partial fulfilment of  ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Fall 2017. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as
our own. The incorporation of the work of others--including but not limited to their ideas,
data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation
marks), or paraphrasing thereof-- has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations
both in the text and the bibliography.

And I understand that:

Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the
same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is
strictly forbidden.

I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.
